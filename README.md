📂 Model comparison using scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)

📉 Trend, seasonality, and anomaly detection

🧪 Cross-validation and performance metrics (MAE, RMSE)

🧪 Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, Prophet, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)

Power BI

Jupyter Notebook

Excel (optional for data cleaning)

VS Code / Anaconda
